Hello,

	This project is my very first ever html/css attempt. My friend Dayne has been teaching me both html/css
on his freetime, roughly once a week. This project was started 2-4-22 and will last until I feel that it is
completely how I imagined it. This project is aiming to create a website for my dad's skateshop that he owned in
2005. Most of the inspriation for this came directly from my dad, other local skateshops, and some big name sites. 

Hope you like it!
